"""
This is a class skeleton for the problem for the Inventory Management problem outlined here: https://staffengprep.com/companies/anthropic/

To use, read through the problem description linked above - starting just with level 1.
Not looking ahead most accurately simulates how things like CodeSignal progressively show you the problem.

After implementing the first level here, run `python inventory_management/test.py --level 1` and progress through all levels to level 3.

See the main readme for disclaimers and other info.

The test suite for the copy behavior was frankly highly confusing to me.
The test suite reflects what the problem says it should be, but I don't thnk the copy behavior as tested is correct.
Do with that as you wish.
