"""
The problem description for this problem is in prompt.md.

To use, read through the problem description linked above - starting just with level 1.
Not looking ahead most accurately simulates how things like CodeSignal progressively show you the problem.

After implementing the first level, run `python bank_ledger/test.py --level 1` and progress through all levels to level 3.

See the main readme for disclaimers and other info.
