# Interview Practice Problems

I used these practice problems when I was prepping for coding interviews. They are a different flavor than LC, focused more around real life problems, instead of "trick" algorithms. Sharing them and the test harnesses I made along the way because I found few resources for practicing for things like the CodeSignal screens.

These are not problems I have seen in interviews and I make no guarantees around the completeness of the test cases (I'm sure they are not complete).

The test harness is purposely a little opaque and the classes are as barebones as possible on purpose :)

Example command to run tests:

```
python chat/test.py --level 1
```

If you find this useful and end up creating more similar problems feel free to open a PR!

A subjective ranking of difficulty from easiest to hardest (but ymmv):

1. Food delivery
2. Bank ledger
3. Chat
4. Inventory management
