"""
This is a class skeleton for the problem for the Chat Messages History problem outlined here: https://staffengprep.com/companies/anthropic/

To use, read through the problem description linked above - starting just with level 1.
Not looking ahead most accurately simulates how things like CodeSignal progressively show you the problem.

After implementing the first level here, run `python chat/test.py --level 1` and progress through all levels to level 4.

See the main readme for disclaimers and other info.
